# Outfitty

## Description : 
Outfitty is a women's fashion e-commerce website that offers a wide range of trendy outfits for every occasion. The site provides a smooth and engaging shopping experience with well-designed front-end interfaces, allowing users to browse products, manage their profiles, and complete orders. The project focuses solely on the front-end development, where I created all the user-facing elements and interactive components, leaving the back-end functionality aside.
